# River-water-Safety
This repository highlights the critical issue of industrial pollution in rivers, where industries discharge harmful chemicals into water bodies, affecting ecosystems and public health. The project aims to identify polluting sources and develop innovative solutions for real-time water quality monitoring.
ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
We propose a capsule-shaped live water quality sensing and monitoring system, which will:

Continuously measure key water quality parameters (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, heavy metals, etc.).

Send real-time data to a cloud-based dashboard for analysis and reporting.

Enable authorities to track pollution sources and take corrective actions.

Solution:
Raspberry Pi that interfaces with multiple sensors to monitor hazardous chemicals in river water. It supports sensors like:

pH Sensor (measures acidity/basicity)

Turbidity Sensor (measures water clarity)

Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (DO, essential for aquatic life)

TDS Sensor (measures Total Dissolved Solids, indicating pollution)

Heavy Metal Sensor (detects toxic metals like lead, mercury)

It collects sensor readings and transmits data to a cloud database using MQTT or HTTP

Requirements:
Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) like ADS1115 (for analog sensors)

Sensors (pH, Turbidity, DO, TDS, Heavy Metals)

Libraries: Adafruit_ADS1x15, paho-mqtt, requests, time
